The tutorial this code is based on:
https://haskell-explained.gitlab.io/blog/posts/2019/07/28/polysemy-is-cool-part-1/index.html
* requires special language extensions
https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy/blob/f2ca91d57d02f8668d0204ec994a717b206e7575/README.md#necessary-language-extensions
Could go in package.yaml -- or maybe that's where they went in earlier versions of Cabal, because
* some handy definitions
** There's also Members
Members [CryptoHash, KeyValueStore k v] r => Sem r a 
  is the same as 
(Member CryptoHash r, Member (KeyValueStore k v) r) => Sem r a
* polysemy-zoo is important too
It defines some Sem instances like KVStore.
